# sudoku solver

Solving sudoku, or rather, a specialized instance of the graph colouring problem.

Build with ```cargo build``` and run with  ```cargo run```.

## Z3 Solver
To run with the z3 solver, install z3 developer libraries first. Then proceed as usual.

Maybe worth mentioning that this program implements an algorithm for graph-colouring that is trivial. JUST LIKE MY LIFE LOL HAHAH :'(
